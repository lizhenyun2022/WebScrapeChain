# WebScrapeChain
WebScrapeChain is a Python-based project that combines web scraping and blockchain technology. It provides a set of tools and utilities to scrape data from websites and store it securely on a blockchain network. The project aims to enhance data integrity, transparency, and immutability by leveraging the power of blockchain technology.

## Features

- Web scraping: Extract data from websites using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests.
- Blockchain interaction: Interact with blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum) using the web3.py library.
- Data storage on the blockchain: Store the scraped data securely on the blockchain.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/lizhenyun2022/WebScrapeChain.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up your environment:

- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
- Configure your blockchain connection settings in the `config.py` file.

## Usage

1. Run the `web_scraper.py` script to scrape data from websites:

python web_scraper.py


The script will extract the specified data from the configured websites.

2. Use the `blockchain_interaction.py` script to interact with the blockchain:


from blockchain_interaction import BlockchainInteraction

blockchain = BlockchainInteraction()

# Example: Store data on the blockchain
data = {'key': 'value'}
transaction_hash = blockchain.store_data(data)

# Example: Retrieve data from the blockchain
stored_data = blockchain.retrieve_data(transaction_hash)

# Customize the blockchain interactions based on your requirements.
Update the script with your blockchain connection settings and customize the interactions based on your data and requirements.
